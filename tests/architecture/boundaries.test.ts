/**
 * Architecture boundary enforcement.

 * These assertions exist because the equivalent rules in
 * `openspec/specs/provider-abstraction/spec.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md` are
 * prose. Prose survives review for a long time and is violated once, under
 * deadline, by someone who did not know it existed. A test costs a few dozen
 * lines and fails loudly instead.
 *
 * Scope note: this is a **tripwire, not a proof of absence.** The field-name
 * check in particular is a heuristic over a fixed list of names measured from
 * real provider responses. It can produce a false positive on an unrelated local
 * identifier. That is the accepted trade: the fix is to rename the local, and a
 * weaker rule that misses real leakage would be worse. Failures name the file
 * and line so the judgement is easy.
